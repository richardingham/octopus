    #
    # Disconnect/Connect Sequence
    # ---------------------------
    #
    # This is the sequence used to select a desired slave
    # device:
    #
    # + The master device sends a 255 ASCII (FF hexadecimal)
    #   character to disconnect all slaves from
    #   the GSIOC.
    #
    # + Using one of the two following methods, the
    #   master device ensures that no slaves are active.
    #   See "Termination Conditions"
    #
    #    - Passive (no break) termination: The master
    #      waits for a period of at least 20 milliseconds
    #      to allow all slaves to disconnect.
    #    - Break active: The master receives a "break"
    #      character as soon as a selected slave disconnects.
    #
    # + The master sends the binary name of the desired
    #   slave device. The value of the binary name is
    #   equal to the unit ID plus 128. For example, if a
    #   unit's ID code is 16, its binary name is 10010000.
    #
    # Note: It is important to recognize the difference
    # between a unit ID and binary name. Unit IDs (with
    # ASCII values 0 to 63) are interpreted by the GSIOC
    # as commands rather than IDs. To distinguish unit
    # Ids from commands, the program sets the high bit to
    # create a unit's binary name.
    #
    #
    # Termination Conditions
    # ----------------------
    #
    # The GSIOC can be terminated in one of two ways.
    #
    # + The master usually terminates the master end of
    #   the slave line so that it receives a break character
    #   when no slave device is selected. This method is
    #   called "break active" and is supported by Gilson
    #   software that controls devices along the GSIOC.
    #
    # + If you develop your own software to control
    #   devices along the GSIOC, choose the simpler
    #   "passive" termination. This avoids error conditions
    #   that may occur when some systems detect
    #   a break character. Some old Gilson masters only
    #   support "passive" termination.
    #
    # To reduce noise on long lines or lines that contain
    # many slaves, terminate the slave end of the GSIOC
    # as well.
    #

    #
    # Immediate Commands
    # ------------------
    #
    # When a master device issues an immediate com-
    # mand to a designated slave, the slave immediately
    # responds to the immediate (high-priority) command.
    #
    # Immediate commands are always in the form of a
    # single character.
    #
    # After a slave device receives an immediate com-
    # mand, it answers the request with the first character
    # of its response. The master checks the ASCII value
    # of the character. If the character's value is less than
    # 128, it responds to the slave with an ACK character
    # (06 hexadecimal). This exchange continues until the
    # slave sends the last character of the response. To
    # indicate that the last character is being sent, the
    # slave adds 128 (80 hexadecimal) to the character's
    # value.
    #
    # In response to an unrecognized immediate com-
    # mand, a slave responds with a pound sign (#), a
    # value of 23 hexadecimal, and adds 128 (80 hexadecimal.)

    # Buffered Commands
    # -----------------
    #
    # A buffered command is defined as a command
    # string of ASCII characters preceded by a line feed
    # (0A hexadecimal) and followed by a carriage return
    # (0D hexadecimal.)
    #
    # After the master device selects a slave device,
    # it begins the buffered command protocol with a single
    # line feed character.
    #
    # If the slave is ready to accept a buffered command, it
    # echoes the line feed to the master. The master then
    # sends each subsequent character in the ASCII com-
    # mand string. As each character is received by the
    # slave, it is echoed to the master for confirmation.
    # When the master sends a carriage return character,
    # the slave knows that the complete command has
    # been sent.
    #
    # If the slave is busy performing a buffered command
    # when the master begins another buffered command,
    # it responds instead with a # sign (23 hexadecimal).
    # The master can continue to send the line feed char-
    # acter until the slave responds with a line feed char-
    # acter. At that time, the rest of the ASCII command
    # string is sent.

#
# Data Compression Format
# -----------------------
#
# The 506C is capable of digitizing analog data. It transfers this data
# to a GSIOC system controller. Because of the large data volumes
# involved, a data compression technique is used to reduce the data load
# on the GSIOC. This also helps to conserve storage space. The
# compression process can be thought of as happening in two steps.
#
# Raw data is collected which could occupy up to a 32-bit field if
# stored as a signed integer. The first level of compression involves
# taking the value of that integer and converting it to a 20-bit
# floating-point number. This number has the most significant four
# bits reserved for a binary exponent between 2**7 power and 2**-7
# power. The lower (the mantissa) representa standard 2's complement
# integer, between 32768 and -32768. This format is easier to work
# with than a 32-bit representation, and it eliminates "noise" bits
# that would interfere with the second level of compression.
#
# For the second stage of compression, the list of 20-bit floating point
# numbers is scanned for similarity between neighboring mantissas.
# Usually there is a fairly high degree of correlation between each
# number and its successor, unless there is a lot of noise. If the
# correlation is high, there is a lot of redundancy which can be removed
# by compression. Since only the lower 16-bits are compared, any change
# to the exponent field requires that an escape code be sent. This
# compression scheme uses five different methods as needed to compress
# the data:
#
# 1. Runs of identical value.
#
#    This method is the most obvious, and often the most efficient.
#    Sixteen codes are used to represent runs from 1 (a single
#    duplication) to 16 (16 duplications) of the same value. This
#    works very well on "quiet" data sets with little noise.
#
# 2. Three values differing by no more than 1 from their predecessor.
#
#    In this method, each of the three values can be one higher, the
#    same as, or one lower than the prior value. This means that a
#    total of 3 x 3 x 3 (or 27) codes must be used to represent these
#    patterns. This is particularly good at handling noise in the
#    least significant bit.
#
# 3. Single samples with small changes.
#
#    This method uses a code to send the next value as a change from
#    the prior value. Thirty seven codes are used to allow changes
#    from 18 below the prior value to 18 above the prior value to be
#    sent in one code. This still offers significant compression
#    even if the data is changing somewhat rapidly.
#
# 4. Single samples with large changes.
#
#    In this case, the compression has failed, and the complete 20-bit
#    value must be sent. One of four different codes is used to signal
#    the start of this 20-bit transmission, and three more data bytes
#    follow to complete the value. This code is used at the beginning
#    of a transfer to set the initial value, and it may be used at
#    intervals to ensure a known value.
#
# 5. No value ready.
#
#    An additional code is reserved to indicate that no value is
#    currently available for transmission. This code is sent if
#    the GSIOC system controller polls an empty device.
#
# The actual ASCII codes used had to be selected to meet the transmission
# restrictions imposed by the GSIOC. The codes selected for each of the
# five cases are listed as follows:
#
# 1. Codes 36..51
#
#    The next (code - 35) values = prior value.
#
# 2. Codes 52..78
#
#    1st value = prior value + ((code - 52) div 9) - 1.
#    2nd value = 1st value + (((code - 52) div 3) mod 3) - 1.
#    3rd value = 2nd value + ((code - 52) mod 3) - 1.
#
# 3. Codes 79..115
#
#    The value = prior va1ue + (code - 97).
#
# 4. Codes 116..119 with following three codes.
#
#    The value = (code - 116) * 262114 +
